Solving the Hadoop small file problem
======================================

1. What is Small file problem in Hadoop
2. How it arises (Batch and Streaming mode)
	i. Streaming
	ii Batch
		- Sqoop
		- CLI
		- DistCp
3. Solution (Streaming): Using flume

4. Solution (Streaming): Preprocessing and storing in a NoSQL database (Hbase)

5. Solution (Batch): Merging before storing in HDFS

6. Solution (Batch): Sequencefile

7. Solution (Batch): Compression

8. Solution (Batch): CombineFileInputFormat



Definition:
Batch system processes the data at a later time than it was ingested into the enterprise whereas streaming systems processes the data as it is acquired
